onedrive sync

I'd like to be able to have my code folder located right off of c:, e.g.: c:\code

BUT, I'd like to have it synchronized via the cloud

Dropbox 
pros: works, it can synch any file, even those outside the - Does it?
cons: paid for storage above 2GB

Onedrive
pros: lots of space, already purchased via o365 subscription
cons: ? can I have a folder appear as off the drive root, and get it to synch across devices? What about at other device ends? 
For instance, if I create the initial data on my ryyzen c:, make a junction on my onedrive for sync, then how do i set it up on
my laptop? I don't think c:\code is replicated/synchronized there. Soft/symbolic links already are problematic, so making a soft
link from onedrive to c:\code doesn't work. OneDrive creates a mirror of everything inside OneDrive, not outside this 'filesystem'

Confirm.

1. Create a test directory off of C: on my Ryzen, include various files. Perhaps this one.
